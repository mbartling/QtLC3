  <h2>Operation</h2>
  <pre>
    <code>
      if (PSR[15] == 0)
        PC = mem[R6]; R6 is the SSP
        R6 = R6+1;
        TEMP = mem[R6];
        R6 = R6+1;
        PSR = TEMP; the privilege mode and condition codes of
        the interrupted process are restored
      else
        Initiate a privilege mode exception;
    </code>
  </pre>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
   If the processor is running in Supervisor mode, the top two elements on the Supervisor Stack are popped and loaded into PC, PSR. If the processor is running in User mode, a privilege mode violation exception occurs.
  </p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <pre>
    <code>
      RTI    ;PC, PSR = top two values popped off stack
    </code>
  </pre>
<hr>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>On an external interrupt or an internal exception, the initiating sequence first changes the privilege mode to Supervisor mode (PSR[15] = 0). Then the PSR and PC of the interrupted program are pushed onto the Supervisor Stack before loading the PC with the starting address of the interrupt or exception service routine. Interrupt and exception service routines run with Supervisor privilege. The last instruction in the service routine is RTI, which returns control to the interrupted program by popping two values off the Supervisor Stack to restore the PC and PSR. In the case of an interrupt, the PC is restored to the address of the instruction that was about to be processed when the interrupt was initiated. In the case of an exception, the PC is restored to either the address of the instruction that caused the exception or the address of the following instruction, depending on whether the instruction that caused the exception is to be re-executed. In the case of an interrupt, the PSR is restored to the value it had when the interrupt was initiated. In the case of an exception, the PSR is restored to the value it had when the exception occurred or to some modified value, depending on the exception.

If the processor is running in User mode, a privilege mode violation exception
occurs. Section A.4 describes what happens in this case.
